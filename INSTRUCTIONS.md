## Phone Spoofing with SpoofTel

SpoofTel is a service that allows users to spoof a call. To complete this task, you will need to have a cell phone handy to review the results. 

- Open your browser and visit the following in your Kali Linux VM:

- - Fill in the information. If you are testing with your phone you can use it both as the “Your number” and the “Destination Number” submission boxes. 
- - Click the place call button and watch the destination phone.
- - Note that this spoofing service also allows you to mask your voice. 

Way back in my day there was a song about a guy who liked Jenny and he “got” Jenny’s number: https://youtu.be/6WTdTwcmxyo?t=49. This song would easily get stuck in my head. So I am spoofing this number.  As you can see on the image I took below, the caller ID is showing Jenny’s number! (I will definitely pick this up.)

- Pretexting Activity
With a partner, write a pretext for how you would convince someone to give up personal information over the phone. What techniques would you use? Remember from earlier lessons that a good pretext always requires the attacker to have ample information about the individual they are attacking. Note that most pretexting is NOT illegal. Law enforcement and security professionals frequently use this technique to gain intel

In this lesson, we learned how to spoof a phone number. In the process, we heard some great music from the 1980s and grasped the potential of what an attacker can do as a result of spoofing a number. We then used our creative ingenuity to write our very own investigative pretext.
